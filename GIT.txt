Day 1
==================================================================
Version Controlling
===========================
This is the process of maintining multiple versions of code
All the team members upload their code(checkin) into a remote
Version Controlling system(VCS).This VCS accepts the code
uploads from mulitple team members and integrates that as one 
project.Next time when the team members download the code they
will be able to access the code created by the entire team

VCS's also preserve the older and later versions of the code
so that at any pointof time we can switch between whichever
version we want

VCS's also keep a track of who is making what kind of changes
at what time

VCS's are of 2 types
========================
1 Centralised Version Controlling System
2 Distributed Version Controlling System

Centralised Version Controlling System
===========================================
Here we  have a central repository into which the team members
upload the code and all the features of version contolling happen
only on this remote server.Eg: SVN

Distributed Version Controlling System
=============================================
Here we have a local repository into which the code is initially 
uploaded where version controlling happens at the level of
inidividual team members and later it will be uploaded to a remote
server where version controlling happens at the level of the entire
team

Installing git on windows
============================
1 Open https://git-scm.com/downloads

2 Download and install git

Installing git on Ubuntu Linux
===================================
1 Update the apt repository
  sudo apt-get update

2 Install git
  sudo apt-get install -y git

Installing git on RHEL,Centos etc
=====================================
1 Update the yum repository
  yum -y update

2 Install git
  yum -y install git

====================================================================
Git on the local machine uses three section
working dir,stagging area and local repository

Working dir or workspace
==============================
This is the folder where the code is created and initially all the files
present here are called a untracked files

Stagging area
==================
This is the buffer zone of git into which the files move before being
sent to the local repository,the files present here are called 
indexed files

Local repository
=====================
Files from the stagging area move to the local repository where
version controlling happens and files here are called as commited files

=======================================================================

Setting up username and emil globally
---------------------------------------------
git config --global user.name "sai krishna"
git config --global user.email "intelliqittrainings@gmail.com"

To see the list of configuration done
git config --global --list

=====================================================================
1 To initilise the current folder as a git repo
  git init
  This will create a hidden folder called as .git and here it
stores all the configurations that are necessary for git to run

2 To send a file into the stagging area
  git add filename
  To send multiple files
  git add file1 file2 file3
  To send all files and folder
  git add .
  Note  . represents current working directory

3 To bring files back from stagging area to untracked section
  git rm --cached filename
  or
  git reset filename

4 To send all the files from stagging area to the local repository
  git commit -m "some msg"

5 To see the status of files in untracked and stagging area
  git status

6 To see the list of commits in the local repository
  git log
  To see the above output in one line format
  git log --oneline

===================================================================
Day 2
===================================================================
.gitignore:This is a special configuration file which is used
to hide the private files info.Any file whose name is mentioned
in .gitignore will no longer be accessed by git

1 Create few files
  touch f1 f2 f3 f4 f5

2 Check the status of git
  git status
  This will show the above 5 files as untracked files

3 Create .gitignore and store the above 5 file names in it
  cat > .gitignore
  f1
  f2
  f3
  f4
  f5
  To come out of cat command press ctrl+d  

4 Check the status of git
  git status
  This will only show .gitignore as untracked
  f1-f5 are no longer accessable by git



==============================================================================
Branching in Git
========================
This is a feature of git using which we can create seperate branches
for different functionalites and later merge them with the main branch
also known as the master branch.This will help in creating the code in
an uncluttered way

1 To see the list of local branches
  git branch

2 To see the list all branches local and remote
  git branch -a

3 To create a branch
  git branch branch_name

4 To move into a branch
  git checkout branch_name

5 To create a branch and also move into it
  git checkout -b branch_name

6 To merge a branch
  git merge branch_name

7 To delete a branch that is merged
  git branch -d branch_name 
  This is also called as soft delete

8 To delete a branch that is not merged
  git branch -D branch_name
  This is also known as hard delete

============================================================================
Note: Whenever a branch is create whatever is the commit history of the 
parent branch will be copied into the new branch

Note: Irrespective of, on which branch a file is created or modified git only
considers form which branch it is commited and the file belongs to that
commited branch only.

============================================================================
Working on the Github
=========================
This is the remote repository into which the code is uploaded and
this process is called as checkin

1 Singup for a github account
2 Signin into that account
3 Click on + on top right corner
4 Click on New repository
5 Enter some repository name
6 Select Public or Private
7 Click on Create repository
8 Go to Push an existing repository from command line and copy paste
  the commands
  Enter username and password of github

========================================================================
Day 3
==========================================================================
Downloading the code from the remote github
===============================================
This can be done in three ways 
git clone
git fetch
git pull

=============================================================
git clone
===============
This will download all the code from the remote repository
into the local repository and it is generally used only once
when all the team members want a copy of the same code

Syntax: git clone remote_git_repo_url

git fetch
==================
This will download only the modified files but it will place
them on a seperate branch called as "remote branch",we can go into
this remote branch check if the modificatios are accpetable and then
merge it with the main branch

1 Open the github
2 Go to the repository that we uploaded
3 Select a file and edit it--->Click on commit changes
4 Open git bash
5 git fetch
6 To see the name of remote branch
  git branch -a
7 To switch into this branch
  git checkout branch_name_from_step6
8 View the modified file
  cat filename
9 If these modifications are ok then merge with main branch
  git checkout main
  git merge branch_name_from_step6


=====================================================================
git pull
===================
This will download only the modified files and merge them with
our local branches
1 Open the github
2 Go to the repository that we uploaded
3 Select a file and edit it--->Click on commit changes
4 Open git bash
5 git pull
  We can see the modified files on the main branch

=======================================================================


Git merging and rebasing
====================================
Merging always happens based on the time stamp of the commit

1 Create few commits on master
  touch f1
  git add .
  git commit -m "a"
  touch f2
  git add .
  git commit -m "b"

2 Check the commit history
  git log --oneline

3 Create a test branch and create few commits on it
  git checkout -b test
  touch f3
  git add .
  git commit -m "c"
  touch f4
  git add .
  git commit -m "d"

4 Check the commit history
  git log --oneline

5 Move to amster and create few more commits
  touch f5
  git add .
  git commit -m "e"
  touch f6
  git add .
  git commit -m "f"

6 Check the commit history
  git log --oneline

7 Merge test with master
  git merge test

8 Check the commit history
  git log --oneline


Rebase is also called a "fastfoward merge"  and this used when
we want the commits from a branch to be projected as the top most 
commits

1 Repeate Step1-6 from above scenario

2 To rebase test with master
  git checkout test
  git rebase master
  git checkout master
  git merge test

3 Check the commit history
  git log --oneline



=============================================================
Day 4
=============================================================
Cherry pick
=====================
This feature allows us to selectively pick only certain
commits and add them to the master branch

1 Create a commit on master
  touch f1
  git add .
  git commit -m "a"

2 Create a  new branch and create few commits on it
  git checkout -b test
  touch f2
  git add .
  git commit -m "b"
  touch f3
  git add .
  git commit -m "c"
  touch f4
  git add .
  git commit -m "d"
  touch f5
  git add .
  git commit -m "e"

3 Check the commit history
  git log --oneline

4 Identify the commits that we want to bring to master
  git checkout master
  git cherry-pick commit_id1 commit_id2
==============================================================================
git reset
=====================
This is used to toggle between multiple versions of the code

This is of three types
1 hard reset
2 soft reset
3 mixed reset

1 Hard reset
  This will move the HEAD to an older commit and also it will 
  show the data as it was present at the time of that older commit

2 Create a file and multiple commits on that file
  file1 --->   one--->commit a

  file1 --->  one,two --->commit b
 
  file1 ----> one,two,three ----> commit c

3 To reset to b commit
  git reset --hard b_commitid
  If we open the file1 we will see the data as present at the time
  of b commit
  
====================================================================
Day 5
====================================================================
===========================================================================
Git stashing
======================
Stash is a section of git into which once the files are pushed 
git cannot access them

To stash all the files present in the stagging area
git stash 

To stash all files present in stagging area and untracked section
git stash -u

To stash all files present in stagging area,untracked section and .gitignore
git stash -a

To see the list of stases
git stash list

To unstash a latest stash
git stash pop

To unstash an older stash
git stash pop stash@{stashno}
==============================================================================
Git tagging
================
This is used to place book marks on important commits
Generally it used to identfy the commits that are related to
release events

Tags are classifed into 2 types
1 Light weight tags
2 Annoted Tags

Light weight tags
======================
These tags only have a tage name
To create a light weight tag to the latest commit
git tag some_tag_name

To create a light weight tag to an older commit
git tag some_tag_name older_commit_id

To create an annoted tag to the latest commit
git tag -a "some_tag_name" -m "some msg related to the tag"

To create an annoted tag for an older commit
git tag -a "some_tag_name" -m "some msg related to the tag" older_commit_id

To see the list of all tags
git tag

To push the tags into remote github
git push --tags

To delete a tag locally
git tag -d tagname

To delete a tag from remote github
git push origin :tag_name

==========================================================
========================================================================
Modifing exisiting commits
================================
We can add content to an exisiting commit without 
creating a new commit using "amend"

1 Create few commits
  a ---> b ---> c
  HEAD is pointing to c commit

2 Create a new file and add it to the c commit
  touch file2
  git add .
  git commit --amend -m "c"

3 Check the commit history
  git log --oneline
  It will show only 3 commits
  a--->b--->c

4 The older c commit is removed from the acitve git structure
  and it is called as an orphaned commit
  git reflog
  This will show all the commits(active and orphaned)
